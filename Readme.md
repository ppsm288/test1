# Test1
Developers work on feature branches.
Once a feature is complete, it's merged into the develop branch.
When it's time for a release, a release branch is created from develop.
After testing and final adjustments, the release branch is merged into both develop and master.
Hotfix branches are created for critical issues in the master branch.
